# Testing Instructions: Synonym Expansion Feature

## Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

All code changes have been implemented successfully with no linting errors!

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **LLM-Based Synonym Generator** (`llm_mapping/synonym_expander.py`)
   - Generates 4-6 medical synonyms for any ICD9 term
   - Uses LLM to understand medical terminology
   - Gracefully handles failures

### 2. **Multi-Query Search** (`llm_mapping/vector_store.py`)
   - New method: `search_multi_query(queries, top_k)`
   - Runs separate searches for each synonym
   - Merges results by taking maximum score
   - Example: If "sexually transmitted disease" matches A64 with score 0.79, but "venereal disease" only scores 0.48, we take 0.79

### 3. **Mapper Integration** (`llm_mapping/mapper.py`)
   - Added `MapperConfig` support
   - When `enable_synonym_expansion=True`:
     1. Generate synonyms via LLM
     2. Search with all variants
     3. Merge results
   - Backward compatible with existing code

### 4. **Configuration** (`llm_mapping/schemas.py`)
   - New `MapperConfig` dataclass with:
     - `enable_synonym_expansion: bool` (default: False)
     - `synonym_top_k: int` (default: 40)
     - Other existing settings

### 5. **CLI Support** (`llm_mapping/run_from_tsv.py`)
   - New flags:
     - `--enable-synonym-expansion`: Turn on the feature
     - `--synonym-top-k N`: Control candidates per query

### 6. **Test Scripts**
   - `test_baseline_40.sh`: Run first 40 records WITHOUT synonyms
   - `test_synonym_expansion_40.sh`: Run first 40 records WITH synonyms
   - `compare_results.py`: Compare and analyze results

## How to Run the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Set OpenAI API Key**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

2. **Activate conda environment**:
   ```bash
   conda activate icd-mapper
   ```

### Run Tests

```bash
cd /Users/davidjakubosky/repos/phenotype_matching_analysis

# Test 1: Baseline (no synonym expansion)
./test_baseline_40.sh

# Test 2: With synonym expansion
./test_synonym_expansion_40.sh

# Compare results
python compare_results.py
```

### What to Look For

The key test case is **ICD9 code 099** (at line 30 of input file):
- **ICD9**: 099 | Other venereal diseases
- **Expected ICD10**: A64 | Unspecified sexually transmitted disease

**Baseline prediction**: Likely selects B99 (Other and unspecified infectious diseases) ‚ùå
**With synonyms**: Should select A64 (Unspecified sexually transmitted disease) ‚úÖ

The comparison script will show:
1. How many mappings changed
2. Confidence score improvements/regressions
3. Specific analysis of the 099 ‚Üí A64 case
4. Overall confidence distribution

## Expected Output

After running both tests and the comparison, you should see:

```
COMPARISON: Baseline vs Synonym Expansion
================================================================================
Number of records: 40

Total differences: X/40 (XX.X%)
  - Potential improvements (higher confidence): Y
  - Potential regressions (lower confidence): Z

SPECIFIC CASE: ICD9 099 (Other venereal diseases)
================================================================================
  Baseline selected: B99 | Other and unspecified infectious diseases
  Synonym selected:  A64 | Unspecified sexually transmitted disease
  ‚úì SUCCESS! Synonym expansion found the correct match (A64)
```

## Output Files

Results will be saved to:
```
output/test_comparisons/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ baseline_40_no_synonyms.csv
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ baseline_40_no_synonyms.jsonl
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ synonym_expansion_40.csv
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ synonym_expansion_40.jsonl
```

## Implementation Details

### Example: How Synonym Expansion Works

**Input**: ICD9 099 | Other venereal diseases

**Step 1 - LLM generates synonyms**:
```json
{
  "synonyms": [
    "sexually transmitted disease",
    "sexually transmitted infection", 
    "STD",
    "STI",
    "venereal infection",
    "unspecified sexually transmitted disease"
  ]
}
```

**Step 2 - Multi-query search**:
```
Query 1: "Other venereal diseases"
  ‚Üí A56: 0.57, A63: 0.56, A64: 0.48

Query 2: "sexually transmitted disease"  
  ‚Üí A64: 0.79 ‚úÖ, A56: 0.62, A63: 0.60

Query 3: "STD"
  ‚Üí A64: 0.69, A56: 0.65
  
... (more queries)
```

**Step 3 - Merge by max score**:
```
A64: max(0.48, 0.79, 0.69, ...) = 0.79  ‚Üê Winner!
A56: max(0.57, 0.62, 0.65, ...) = 0.65
A63: max(0.56, 0.60, ...) = 0.60
```

**Step 4 - LLM selection**:
With A64 now in top-5 candidates (instead of not in top-40), the final LLM correctly selects it.

## Cost Implications

For 40 records with synonym expansion:
- **Additional LLM calls**: 40 synonym generation calls
- **Additional embeddings**: ~5-6x per record (original + synonyms)
- **Total LLM calls**: ~2x baseline (80 vs 40)
- **Worth it?**: If accuracy improves significantly, YES!

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "The api_key client option must be set"**
- Solution: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"`

**Error: "faiss-cpu is required"**
- Solution: `pip install faiss-cpu sentence-transformers`

**Tests run but 099 doesn't map to A64**
- Check: Is A64 in the vector store?
  ```bash
  grep "^A64" ICD10_mapping_universe.tsv
  ```
- Check: Are synonyms being generated?
  - Look at JSONL output for synonym details in audit trail

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Analyze Results**: Run comparison and review differences
2. **Tune if Needed**:
   - Adjust `synonym_top_k` if needed
   - Refine synonym generation prompt
3. **Scale Up**: If successful, run on full 1085 records
4. **Production**: Set `--enable-synonym-expansion` as default if accuracy improves
